Okay, I need to write an SQL query based on the given schema and the text description provided. Let me break down what's needed step by step.

First, the goal is to find the supplier who contributed the most to the overall revenue for parts shipped during the first quarter of 1995. If there's a tie, list all such suppliers in order of their supplier number.

The revenue calculation is given as sum(extended price * (1 - discount)). So I need to calculate this for each part shipment and then associate it with the correct supplier.

Looking at the schema:

- The orders are handled by the ORDERS table, which connects to CUSTOMER via C_NATIONKEY. But since we're dealing with parts shipped, maybe the relevant customer is not directly needed unless there's a condition on it, which isn't specified here.

- The parts themselves are in PART, but for each part shipment, I need to look at the supplier. That's where the PARTSUPP table comes in because it links PART and SUPPLIER via PS_SUPPKEY.

So my plan is:

1. Join ORDERS with LINEITEM on O_ORDERKEY and L_ORDERKEY to get all details about each order line.
2. Then join LINEITEM with PARTSUPP on L_PARTKEY and PS_PARTKEY to connect part details with their suppliers.
3. Additionally, I need to ensure that the parts were shipped during the first quarter of 1995. The ship date (L_SHIPDATE) should be between January 1, 1995, and March 31, 1995.

Once I have all these linked tables together, I can calculate the revenue for each supplier by summing up the extended price adjusted by discount.

But wait, since parts are shared among suppliers, each part might be shipped multiple times to different suppliers. So grouping by SUPPLIER is necessary to aggregate their contributions.

The formula for revenue is (extended price * (1 - discount)). Looking at LINEITEM, that's L_EXTENDEDPRICE multiplied by (1 - L_DISCOUNT). I need to sum this value across all relevant lines for each supplier.

Putting it all together, the query will:

- Select distinct SUPPLIER names.
- For each supplier, calculate the total revenue from parts they supplied in Q1 1995.
- Order the suppliers by their numeric key (S_SUPPKEY) in ascending order after sorting them alphabetically by name. Wait, no— the text says "supplier number order," which is likely numerical. So I should sort by S_SUPPKEY numerically.

Potential issues to consider:

- Ensuring that all dates are correctly within Q1 1995.
- Making sure that each part and its corresponding supplier pair (PARTSUPP) are correctly linked with the line item.
- Summing the revenue for each supplier accurately, even if they supplied multiple parts or quantities.

So I'll structure the query with subqueries to get all necessary details first. But since joining tables can be done in one step, perhaps using LEFT JOINs where necessary.

I might need to use Common Table Expressions (CTEs) because of potential data integrity issues when joining multiple tables at once.

Wait, but looking back, each LINEITEM has a corresponding PS_PARTKEY and PS_SUPPKEY. So if I join ORDERS with LINEITEM on O_ORDERKEY and L_ORDERKEY, then join that result with PARTSUPP on L_PARTKEY and PS_PARTKEY, this should link all the necessary data correctly.

So the final query will involve multiple joins:

1. Join ORDERS (O) with LINEITEM (L) on O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY.
2. Then join this result with PARTSUPP (PS) on L_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY and L_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY.
3. Add a condition where L_SHIPDATE is between '1995-01-01' and '1995-03-31'.
4. Group by SUPPLIER (S_SUPPKEY, S_NAME), then calculate the sum of extended price*(1 - discount).
5. Order the results first by supplier name alphabetically, then by their numeric key.

Wait, but for ordering: "presented in supplier number order." So after getting all suppliers with their total revenue, I need to sort them numerically based on S_SUPPKEY and then alphabetically? Or is it just numerical?

The text says "supplier number order," so likely, the primary key is the numeric value of S_SUPPKEY, followed by alphabetical for same numbers. But in SQL, when you specify a sort key that's not unique, it uses the next column to break ties.

But since S_SUPPKEY is an integer and each supplier has a unique number (since it's a primary key), sorting numerically will suffice. So I can order by S_SUPPKEY in ascending order after calculating the sum.

So putting it all together:

- SELECT DISTINCT S_SPPKEY, S_NAME.
- FROM ORDERS O JOIN LINEITEM L ON O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY.
- Then from that join to PARTSUPP PS on L_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY and L_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY.
- WHERE L_SHIPDATE between '1995-01-01' and '1995-03-31'.
- GROUP BY S_SPPKEY, S_NAME.
- ORDER BY S_SPPKEY.

Wait, but in the query I have to write, it's better to structure it correctly with proper joining. However, since SQL allows only one join per table, perhaps using a CTE would be more efficient and avoid confusion.

Alternatively, use subqueries:

But maybe a single CTE is sufficient. Alternatively, chain all joins together as in:

SELECT S_SPPKEY, S_NAME,
       SUM(L_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - L_DISCOUNT)) AS REVENUE
FROM ORDERS O
JOIN LINEITEM L ON O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY
JOIN PARTSUPP PS ON L_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY AND L_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY
WHERE L_SHIPDATE BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-03-31'
GROUP BY S_SPPKEY, S_NAME
ORDER BY S_SPPKEY.

Wait, but the group by includes both S_SPPKEY and S_NAME. Then order by S_SPPKEY will just sort numerically because each S_SPPKEY is unique per supplier.

But in SQL, when you have multiple columns in a GROUP BY, the ordering applies to all columns unless specified otherwise. So if I only specify GROUP BY S_SPPKEY, but ORDER BY S_SPPKEY, that's fine.

However, looking at the text description again: "Revenue calculation as sum(extended price*(1-discount))", which is correct in the query.

But wait, in the query above, the calculated sum would be per line item. But each part could have multiple entries for different suppliers or same parts? Wait no—each order line has a unique PS_PARTKEY and PS_SUPPKEY, so it's one entry per supplier per part.

So grouping by S_SPPKEY (suppliers) is correct because we want the total revenue per supplier.

Wait, but in that case, each supplier could have multiple entries if they supplied different parts. So summing their contributions across all parts is correct.

But I think I need to group by both the customer and the supplier? Wait no— the problem doesn't mention anything about customers here. It's just looking for the total contribution from the supplier regardless of which customer it's linked to, as long as it's during Q1
1995.

So I think the initial query is correct.

Wait, but in the schema, there's a CUSTOMER table with C_CUSKEY and C_NAME. The ORDERS are linked via C_NATIONKEY to CUSTOMER, so each order is tied to a customer based on their nation key. But since the problem doesn't specify any conditions related to the customer
(like specific country), perhaps we don't need to include it in the join.

Wait no—since we have only one condition on ship date and part, maybe the customer isn't needed unless there's another condition. Since all else is neutral, perhaps I can exclude the customer table from the join because the problem doesn't specify any nation-based
conditions beyond the first quarter 1995.

So revising the query: we don't need to include the customer in the join since it wasn't specified as a filter or part of the grouping. So our main join is between ORDERS and LINEITEM, then to PARTSUPP.

Wait, but if I'm only interested in the revenue from parts supplied during Q1 1995 by each supplier, regardless of which customer they belong to (as long as it's a valid shipment), perhaps the query can be structured without involving the customer table unless
necessary. But since there's no condition on the customer side except through the orders and line items, maybe we don't need to include the customer in the join.

So revising: The correct approach is:

1. Join ORDERS (O) with LINEITEM (L) on O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY.
2. Then from that result, join with PARTSUPP (PS) on L_PARTKEY = PS_PARTKEY and L_SUPPKEY = PS_SUPPKEY.
3. Apply the ship date condition to L_SHIPDATE.

But perhaps I can chain all joins into a single query for simplicity.

So putting it together:

SELECT s_ssuppkey, s_name,
       sum(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) as revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN lineitem l ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
JOIN partsupp ps ON l_partkey = ps_partkey AND l_suppkey = ps_suppkey
WHERE l_shipdate BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-03-31'
GROUP BY s_ssuppkey, s_name
ORDER BY s_ssuppkey;

But wait, in this case, the orders are linked to line items via order key, and then line items to partsupp via partkey and suppkey. So for each order line item (l), which is a shipment of a particular part from a supplier.

This should give me per supplier, their total revenue from that quarter's shipments.

Wait, but in this setup, the orders table may have multiple entries per customer, but as we're not joining it with the customers, perhaps we are losing some context. But since the problem doesn't specify any constraints related to customers or nations beyond the ship
date and part key, maybe this is acceptable.

Alternatively, if we only need to consider all such shipments across all customers in 1995 Q1, regardless of which customer they belong to, then excluding the customer table from the join would be correct. So that's what I have above.

But let me check: The problem says "during the first quarter of 1995" but doesn't specify a particular nation or company. Therefore, including all shipments across all nations and customers during Q1 '95 is appropriate.

Therefore, in this case, the correct query would involve joining orders with line items (to get the part details) then to partsupp, apply ship date condition, group by supplier, sum the revenue, and order by s_ssuppkey.

But wait: The line item has l extendedprice * (1 - discount). So yes, that's per shipment. And each shipment is linked to a part (line item) which comes from the supplier (partsupp).

Wait— but perhaps there are multiple line items for the same part from different suppliers? Or no?

No, because partsupp gives us the specific supplier per part. Each line item in the lineitem table would have exactly one partsupp entry linked via l_partkey and l_suppkey.

So each line item can be linked back to a single partsupp row (if any) with matching partkey and suppkey.

Therefore, this query should correctly sum for each supplier all the revenue from their shipments during Q1 '95.

Another point: In this approach, I'm assuming that every shipment (lineitem) is associated with exactly one partsupp. But if a part has been supplied by multiple suppliers in different lines, perhaps via different lineitems. So yes, summing for each partsupp would
capture their total.

But wait—each lineitem can only have one partsupp entry; because it's linked on l_partkey and l_suppkey. Therefore, the query is correctly structured.

So I think this approach should work.

Alternatively, perhaps I need to include the customer in the join if there are conditions related to the nation key, but since no such condition exists here beyond ship date and part key, we can proceed without that.

Wait a second— the problem didn't specify any constraints on customers or nations. Therefore, all relevant data is captured by the line items linked via partsupp with ship date in Q1 '95.

Thus, my final query would be as follows:

SELECT s_ssuppkey AS suppkey, s_name,
       SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM orders o
JOIN lineitem l ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
JOIN partsupp ps ON l_partkey = ps_partkey AND l_suppkey = ps_ssuppkey
WHERE l_shipdate BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-03-31'
GROUP BY s_ssuppkey, s_name
ORDER BY suppkey;

Wait— in the query above, I have to rename columns because they are aliased.

But let's make it clearer:

In SQL, when you alias a column from a CTE or subquery, you can get warnings. Therefore, better to use proper aliases without duplicates.

Alternatively, group by s_ssuppkey and s_name directly:

But in the FROM clause, we have orders o joined with lineitem l on o_orderkey = l_orderkey, then joined with partsupp ps on l_partkey = ps_partkey AND l_suppkey = ps_ssuppkey. So for each such combination.

So grouping by s_ssuppkey and s_name will group per supplier.

Then, order the results by s_ssuppkey in ascending numerical order to sort them correctly.

But wait: The problem statement says "customer nation" but didn't specify further constraints—so I might have missed something. Let me re-examine the problem.

Problem Statement:
- We need to find for each supplier during Q1 '95, their total revenue (after discounts).

No mention of customers or nations beyond that—so all orders in Q1 '95, regardless of customer, are considered.

Therefore, my initial approach is correct.

Testing this logic with sample data would be helpful. Let me think about it:

Sample Data:

Orders:
- Order 1: shipped to part A by supplier X on Jan 1.
- Order 2: shipped to part B by supplier Y on Feb 15.
LineItems:
Each corresponds to their respective orders, so they should link correctly.

Thus, the query should sum for X and Y as per sample data, with totals based on each shipment's extended price * (1 - discount).

Another point: If a partsupp entry is not linked via lineitem, it would be excluded. But in this case, all relevant data comes through the joins.

Therefore, I think my approach is correct.
</think>

To solve this problem, we need to determine the total revenue for each supplier during the first quarter of 1995 after accounting for discounts on their shipments. The approach involves analyzing the shipment details and supplier information to calculate the net revenue
accurately.

### Approach
The solution can be broken down into several key steps:

1. **Data Collection**: We need data from three tables:
   - `orders`: Contains order details, including order key.
   - `lineitem`: Links each line item (shipment detail) to an order and provides shipment details like part key and discount.
   - `partsupp`: Provides supplier information for each part.

2. **Join Operations**: We join the tables to map each shipment (`lineitem`) to its respective supplier (`partsupp`). This allows us to link line items from orders to their corresponding suppliers via shared keys (order key, part key, and supplier key).

3. **Filter by Timeframe**: Only consider shipments that occurred during the first quarter of 1995.

4. **Revenue Calculation**: For each shipment, calculate the net revenue as `extendedprice * (1 - discount)`.

5. **Grouping and Aggregation**: Group the results by supplier to sum up their total net revenue for the period.

6. **Sorting**: Order the result by the supplier's key in ascending numerical order.

### Solution Code

```sql
SELECT
    s_ssuppkey AS suppkey,
    s_name,
    SUM(l_extendedprice * (1 - l_discount)) AS revenue
FROM
    orders o
JOIN
    lineitem l ON o_orderkey = l_orderkey
JOIN
    partsupp ps ON l_partkey = ps_partkey AND l_suppkey = ps_ssuppkey
WHERE
    l_shipdate BETWEEN '1995-01-01' AND '1995-03-31'
GROUP BY
    s_ssuppkey, s_name
ORDER BY
    suppkey;
```

### Explanation
The provided SQL query achieves the objective by:
- Joining `orders`, `lineitem`, and `partsupp` tables to link each shipment with its supplier.
- Filtering shipments that occurred during Q1 '95 using `WHERE`.
- Summing up the net revenue for each supplier in the specified timeframe.
- Grouping results by supplier key and name, then sorting them alphabetically by supplier key.

This approach ensures we accurately calculate the total revenue per supplier while considering all relevant shipment details.
