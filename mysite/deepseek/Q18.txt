Okay, I need to write an SQL query based on the given schema that finds the top 100 customers who have placed more than 300 orders. The output should include the customer's name, customer key, order key, order date, total price, and quantity.

First, let me identify which tables are involved. I know that the ORDERS table has information about each order, including customer details through the CUSTOMER table. So, I'll need to join the ORDERS and CUSTOMER tables using their common foreign keys.

The primary key for ORDERS is O_ORDERKEY, and for CUSTOMER it's C_CUSTKEY. Additionally, the ORDERS table also references the CUSTOMER via O_CUSTKEY.

I want to count how many orders each customer has placed. So I'll need a subquery or some way to aggregate the order counts per customer.

Since I need customers with more than 300 orders, I can filter those who have a total order count over 300 after grouping by their customer key (C_CUSTKEY).

Once I have that list, I also want to include each customer's top order details: the order key, date, total price, and quantity.

Let me outline the steps:

1. Join ORDERS and CUSTOMER tables on O_CUSTKEY and C_CUSTKEY.
2. Group by C_CUSTKEY to calculate the count of orders per customer.
3. Filter out customers with a total order count greater than 300.
4. From these selected customers, retrieve their top order details: including the first occurrence (which would be the earliest date? Or maybe just one since they have many orders).
5. Limit the results to the top 100 customers.

Wait, but if each customer has multiple orders, how do I select only one order per customer in step 4? Maybe it's better not to limit at this stage and then limit after grouping by customer.

Alternatively, perhaps I should join the ORDERS table with CUSTOMER on O_CUSTKEY, group by C_CUSTKEY, count the number of orders (O_ORDERKEYs), filter where the count is >300, and then get each customer's first order or any one of their orders as representative. But for this
query, since I just need to list all customers who have >300 orders along with some details from their orders, maybe it's sufficient to group by C_CUSTKEY, include the total count, filter, and then select all rows but also join again to get order details.

But in SQL, grouping can be done within a subquery. So I think using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) would help structure this better.

Alternatively, without using CTEs, it's possible with the query itself by first selecting customers based on their count and then joining for order details.

Let me try to outline the exact SQL steps:

- SELECT COUNT(*) FROM ORDERS WHERE O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY; That gives a subquery for each customer.

But in practice, I can't write it that way directly. Instead, perhaps using a subquery inside a GROUP BY clause.

Wait, maybe using a Common Table Expression to first get the counts:

WITH CustomerCounts AS (
    SELECT C.CUSTOMER_KEY, COUNT(O.O_ORDERKEY) AS ORDER_COUNT
    FROM ORDERS O
    JOIN CUSTOMER C ON O.CUSTKEY = C.CUSTKEY
    GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY
)
SELECT C.N_NAME, C.C_CUSTKEY, O2.O_ORDERKEY, O2.O_DATE, O2.TOTAL_PRICE, O2.QUANTITY
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN CustomerCounts CC ON C.CUSTOMER_KEY = CC.CUSTOMER_KEY
WHERE CCORDER_COUNT > 300;
But wait, this would give only one order per customer.

Alternatively, to get all the orders for those customers who have more than 300 orders:

SELECT C.N_NAME, C.C_CUSTKEY,
       MIN(O.O_ORDERKEY) AS O_ORDERKEY,
       MIN(O.O_DATE), -- earliest date
       MAX(O.TOTAL_PRICE), -- highest price?
       SUM(O.QUANTITY) AS TOTAL_QUANTITY
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN ORDERS O ON C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY
GROUP BY C.C_CUSTKEY
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT O.O_ORDERKEY) > 300;
And then order this result set by total quantity or something else.

Wait, but the original request mentions including "the order key, date and total price and the quantity for the order." So perhaps each customer's maximum order value?

Alternatively, maybe it's sufficient to include all orders from those customers with more than 300 orders. But since we need only one entry per customer in the output list, I should aggregate their order details.

But in the example response, they just selected for each customer a single order: selecting top 100 based on some criteria (maybe total quantity) and then including that one order's data.

In this case, to get all customers with more than 300 orders and include any of their orders' details, but likely the earliest or most significant.

So perhaps I can first select the customers who have more than 300 orders, group them, then join to get an arbitrary order (maybe the first one) from each customer.

But in SQL, grouping by C.CUSTOMER_KEY and having a subquery on O.O_ORDERKEY count is needed. Let's try writing it step by step.

First, write the inner query that counts orders per customer:

SELECT COUNT(*) as total_orders
FROM ORDERS
WHERE O_CUSTKEY = C_CUSTKEY;

But to get this for each customer, perhaps within a SELECT statement using an aggregate function inside a GROUP BY clause.

So here's a possible structure:

- Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first calculate the order counts per customer.
- Then join the ORDERS and CUSTOMER tables on C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY where O.O_CUSTKEY is in those customers with more than 300 orders.

But I'm getting tangled here. Maybe it's easier without using a CTE:

SELECT C.*
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN ORDERS O ON C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY
GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY
HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT O.O_ORDERKEY) > 300;

This would give all customers with more than 300 orders, each with only one row. Then I can join again to get the order details.

Wait:

So perhaps:

SELECT C.*
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN (
    SELECT C.CUSTOMER_KEY, COUNT(O.O_ORDERKEY) AS ORDER_COUNT
    FROM ORDERS O
    JOIN CUSTOMER C ON O.CUSTKEY = C.CUSTKEY
    GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY
    HAVING ORDER_COUNT > 300
)
AS CC ON C.CUSTOMER_KEY = CC.CUSTOMER_KEY

But this only returns the customer's data, not the order details.

So then to include an order detail from each selected customer:

I think I need a different approach. Maybe write a subquery that selects all customers with more than 300 orders and includes one of their orders.

Wait, perhaps use a correlated subquery in the main SELECT clause.

Alternatively, let's try writing this as follows:

SELECT C.*,
       O.O_ORDERKEY,
       O.O_DATE,
       O.TOTAL_PRICE,
       O.QUANTITY
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN ORDERS O ON C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY
GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY
HAVING COUNT(O.O_ORDERKEY) > 300;

But this way, for each customer with more than 300 orders, we select only one orderâ€”probably the first one in the result set.

Alternatively, if I want to get all customers' top (most recent?) order details:

Maybe use MIN or MAX on O.O_DATE. For example, using MIN(O.O_DATE) would give the earliest date for that customer; MAX gives the latest.

But since it's arbitrary, perhaps just include one row per customer, regardless of which order is included.

So putting this together: I need to select all customers with more than 300 orders (from ORDERS table), and then join to get their details from ORDERS. Since each group by C.CUSTOMER_KEY will have multiple rows in ORDERS, but the joining on C ensures we only pick one row per
customer.

Wait, but that wouldn't be correct because for each customer, I need all their orders or just a representative one.

But since the original question is about getting top 100 customers based on some criteria (maybe total quantity) and including an order's details from them, perhaps it's better to structure as follows:

Firstly, find the top 100 customers with more than 300 orders. Then for each of those, pick one order.

But in SQL, how would that look?

I think using a subquery within the main SELECT statement.

Alternatively, here's an approach: First get all customers who have more than 300 orders. For these customers, select any single order (e.g., first occurrence) to include in their row.

This can be done with:

SELECT C.*
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN (
    SELECT C.CUSTOMER_KEY,
           COUNT(O.O_ORDERKEY) AS ORDER_COUNT
    FROM ORDERS O
    JOIN CUSTOMER C ON O.CUSTKEY = C.CUSTKEY
    GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY
    HAVING ORDER_COUNT > 300
)
AS CC
ON C.CUSTOMER_KEY = CC.CUSTOMER_KEY

But this only gives the customer's data, not any order details.

To get an order detail from these customers:

Perhaps in another step. So first, select a list of customers with more than 300 orders (without their order details), then join again to get one order per customer.

Here's how that would look:

SELECT C.*
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN (
    SELECT C.CUSTOMER_KEY,
           COUNT(O.O_ORDERKEY) AS ORDER_COUNT
    FROM ORDERS O
    JOIN CUSTOMER CC ON O.CUSTKEY = CC.CUSTKEY
    GROUP BY CC.CUSTOMER_KEY
    HAVING ORDER_COUNT > 300
)
AS CC
ON C.CUSTOMER_KEY = CC.CUSTOMER_KEY

Then join again to get an order:

SELECT *, O.O_ORDERKEY, O.O_DATE, O.TOTAL_PRICE, O.QUANTITY
FROM (
    SELECT C.* FROM CUSTOMER C
    JOIN (SELECT C.CUSTOMER_KEY, COUNT(O.O_ORDERKEY) AS ORDER_COUNT FROM ORDERS O JOIN CUSTOMER CC ON O.CUSTKEY = CC.CUSTKEY GROUP BY CC.CUSTOMER_KEY HAVING ORDER_COUNT > 300 ) AS CC ON C.CUSTOMER_KEY = CC.CUSTOMER_KEY
) CC Inner Join ORDERS O ON CC.CUSTOMER_KEY = O.CUSTKEY

Wait, perhaps I'm overcomplicating this. Maybe just do the following:

First, get all customers with more than 300 orders. Then for each of these, select an order (say, from a specific year or any).

But since we're dealing with data that's probably time-based, selecting the most recent order makes sense.

So here's how to structure it:

1. Find all customers who have placed more than 300 orders.
2. For each such customer, select their latest order (to include in their row).
3. Order these customers by some criteria (like total quantity) and limit the result to top 100.

So putting this into SQL might look like:

WITH CustomerOrders AS (
    SELECT C.*
    FROM CUSTOMER C
    JOIN ORDERS O ON C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY
    WHERE O trans_id > ... etc.
)
SELECT C.*,
       O.O_ORDERKEY,
       O.O_DATE,
       O.TOTAL_PRICE,
       O.QUANTITY
FROM (
    SELECT C.*
    FROM CUSTOMER C
    JOIN ORDERS O ON C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY
    GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY
    HAVING COUNT(DISTINCT O.O_ORDERKEY) > 300
)
AS CustomerCount
JOIN CustomerOrders ON CustomerCount.CUSTOMER_KEY = CustomerOrders.CUSTKEY
WHERE (SELECT SUM(CustomerOrders.QUANTITY) FROM CustomerOrders WHERE CustomerOrders.CUSTOMER_KEY = CustomerCount.CUSTOMER_KEY) DESC LIMIT 100;

Hmm, maybe that's not the best approach.

Alternatively, here's another way:

Use a correlated subquery to select the top customers based on some criteria and their latest order.

But perhaps it's better to structure this in multiple steps. First, get all relevant data for customers with more than 300 orders, then sort them by total quantity and limit to 100.

Alternatively, let me consider writing this as:

SELECT C.*,
       O.O_ORDERKEY,
       O.O_DATE,
       O.TOTAL_PRICE,
       O.QUANTITY
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN ORDERS O ON C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY
GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY, O.O_ORDERKEY
HAVING COUNT(O.O_ORDERKEY) > 300;

Wait, but this still groups by customer and order, which doesn't help.

I think the key here is that for each customer with more than 300 orders, I need to select a single orderâ€”probably their most recent one. So perhaps:

SELECT C.*,
       (SELECT MIN(O.O_DATE) FROM ORDERS O WHERE C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY AND COUNT(DISTINCT O.O_ORDERKEY) > 300) AS MinDate
FROM CUSTOMER C

No, that won't work because the subquery inside SELECT is evaluated for each row. Instead, I should first find all customers with more than 300 orders and then select their latest order.

So maybe:

WITH CustomerOrdersCount AS (
    SELECT C.*
    FROM CUSTOMER C
    JOIN ORDERS O ON C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY
    WHERE COUNT(DISTINCT O.O_ORDERKEY) > 300
),
CustomerLatestOrder AS (
    SELECT C.*,
           (SELECT MIN(O.O_DATE) FROM ORDERS O WHERE C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY AND COUNT(DISTINCT O.O_ORDERKEY) > 300) AS MinDate
    FROM CUSTOMER C
)
SELECT C.*,
       COC.LatestOrderDate
FROM CustomerLatestOrder

Wait, I'm getting confused here. Maybe it's better to use a subquery that calculates the total quantity for each customer and then joins on that.

Perhaps:

SELECT C.*
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN (
    SELECT C.CUSTOMER_KEY, SUM(O.QUANTITY) AS TotalQuantity
    FROM ORDERS O
    WHERE O.CUSTKEY = C.CUSTOMER_KEY AND COUNT(DISTINCT O.O_ORDERKEY) > 300
    GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY
    ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC LIMIT 100
)
AS SubQuery ON C.CUSTOMER_KEY = SubQuery.CUSTOMER_KEY

But this would only select the top customers based on total quantity. Maybe.

Alternatively, to get all customers with more than 300 orders and then sort them:

SELECT C.*
FROM CUSTOMER C
WHERE COUNT(DISTINCT ORDERS.O_ORDERKEY) > 300;

Then join this list with their latest order.

But I think it's time to provide a clear answer. The SQL query will first select all customers who have made more than 300 orders, then for each of these customers, find the most recent order (to include in their row), and finally sort these customers by some metricâ€”maybe
total quantity soldâ€”and limit to the top 100.

So here's a possible SQL query:

WITH CustomerOrdersCount AS (
    SELECT C.*
    FROM CUSTOMER C
    JOIN ORDERS O ON C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY
    GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY
    HAVING COUNT(O.O_ORDERKEY) > 300
),
LatestOrderPerCustomer AS (
    SELECT C.*,
           (SELECT MIN(O.O_DATE) FROM ORDERS O WHERE C.CUSTKEY = O.CUSTKEY AND C trans_id > ... etc.) AS LatestDate
    FROM CUSTOMER C
)
SELECT C.*
FROM CustomerOrdersCount, LatestOrderPerCustomer
WHERE CustomerOrdersCount.CUSTOMER_KEY = LatestOrderPerCustomer.CUSTOMER_KEY

But I'm not sure about the exact syntax here. Maybe a better approach is to use a subquery that calculates for each customer their latest order date and then orders by total quantity.

So perhaps:

SELECT C.*
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN (
    SELECT C.CUSTOMER_KEY,
           SUM(O.QUANTITY) AS TotalQuantity,
           MIN(O.O_DATE) AS LatestOrderDate
    FROM ORDERS O
    WHERE O.CUSTKEY = C.CUSTOMER_KEY AND COUNT(DISTINCT O.O_ORDERKEY) > 300
    GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY
)
AS CustomerInfo ON C.CUSTOMER_KEY = CustomerInfo.CUSTOMER_KEY
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC LIMIT 100;

This might work. It first groups the orders per customer, sums their total quantity (which would be greater than zero if they have multiple orders), and selects only those with more than 300 orders? Wait, noâ€”the count of distinct order keys is needed.

Actually, in the subquery within CustomerInfo, we need to group by customer key and then check that there are more than 300 distinct orders. So:

SELECT C.*
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN (
    SELECT C.CUSTOMER_KEY,
           COUNT(DISTINCT O.O_ORDERKEY) AS OrderCount,
           SUM(O.QUANTITY) AS TotalQuantity,
           MIN(O.O_DATE) AS LatestOrderDate
    FROM ORDERS O
    WHERE O.CUSTKEY = C.CUSTOMER_KEY
    GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY
    HAVING OrderCount > 300
)
AS CustomerInfo ON C.CUSTOMER_KEY = CustomerInfo.CUSTOMER_KEY
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC LIMIT 100;

Yes, that makes sense. So this query will first join the customer and orders table, count distinct orders per customer (if over 300), sum their total quantity, get the latest order date, and then sort these customers by total quantity in descending order, limiting to top 100.
</think>

To identify the top customers who have placed more than 300 orders and limit the results to the top 100 based on total quantity sold, you can use this SQL query:

```sql
SELECT C.*
FROM CUSTOMER C
JOIN (
    SELECT C.CUSTOMER_KEY,
           COUNT(DISTINCT O.O_ORDERKEY) AS OrderCount,
           SUM(O.QUANTITY) AS TotalQuantity,
           MIN(O.O_DATE) AS LatestOrderDate
    FROM ORDERS O
    WHERE O.CUSTKEY = C.CUSTOMER_KEY
    GROUP BY C.CUSTOMER_KEY
    HAVING OrderCount > 300
)
AS CustomerInfo ON C.CUSTOMER_KEY = CustomerInfo.CUSTOMER_KEY
ORDER BY TotalQuantity DESC LIMIT 100;
```

This query:
1. Joins the `CUSTOMER` and `ORDERS` tables.
2. Groups by customer key and calculates:
   - OrderCount: Number of distinct orders (must be >300).
   - TotalQuantity: Sum of all quantities for these orders.
   - LatestOrderDate: Date of the most recent order.
3. Orders the results by total quantity in descending order and limits to 100 customers.

The final result will show the top 100 customers based on their total quantity sold, among those with over 300 orders.
