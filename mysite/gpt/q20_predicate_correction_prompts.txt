Here is a business description D:
The identifies suppliers who have an excess of ivory parts available; an excess is defined to be more than 50% of the parts like the given part that the supplier shipped in the year of 1995 for France. Only parts whose names share a mention of ivory are considered.

Here is a SQL query Q, potentially matching the description:
Select s_name, s_address
 From lineitem, nation, part, partsupp, supplier
 Where lineitem.l_partkey = part.p_partkey
 and part.p_partkey = partsupp.ps_partkey
 and lineitem.l_suppkey = partsupp.ps_suppkey
 and partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey
 and nation.n_nationkey = supplier.s_nationkey
 and nation.n_name = 'FRANCE'
 and lineitem.l_quantity <= 9687.99
 and lineitem.l_shipdate between '1995-01-01' and '1995-12-31'
 and part.p_name LIKE '%ivory%'
 and partsupp.ps_availqty >= 12
 Order By s_name asc;

Validate each of the Where clause predicate in Q against D.
That is, if a predicate in Q does not match with any sentence in D, list it as "Bogus".
If a match found in D, list is as "Correct".

** Did not list the detailed explainations***
Summary
Here is the status of each predicate:

Predicate	Status
lineitem.l_partkey = part.p_partkey	Bogus
part.p_partkey = partsupp.ps_partkey	Correct
lineitem.l_suppkey = partsupp.ps_suppkey	Bogus
partsupp.ps_suppkey = supplier.s_suppkey	Correct
nation.n_nationkey = supplier.s_nationkey	Correct
nation.n_name = 'FRANCE'	Correct
lineitem.l_quantity <= 9687.99	Bogus
lineitem.l_shipdate between '1995-01-01' and '1995-12-31'	Correct
part.p_name LIKE '%ivory%'	Correct
partsupp.ps_availqty >= 12	Bogus


Prompt: I know all the join predicates are correct. Revise your list as per that.
