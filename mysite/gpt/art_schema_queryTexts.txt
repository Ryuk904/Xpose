Q1:
Text:
"The Query provides a summary pricing report for all paintings transported as of a given date. The date
is within 3 days of the greatest transport date contained in the database. The query lists totals for sales price,
discounted sales price, discounted sales price plus tax, average quantity, average sales price, and average discount.
These aggregates are grouped by RETURNFLAG and SERIESTATUS,
and listed in ascending order of RETURNFLAG and SERIESTATUS.
A count of the number of paintings in each group is included.
1998-12-01 is the highest possible transport date as defined in the database population."

Q2:
 Text:
 "The Query finds, in Europe, for each artwork made of Brass and of size 15, the art dealer who can supply it
 at minimum cost. If several European art dealers offer the desired artwork type and size at the same (minimum) cost, the query lists the parts from
 art dealers with the 100 highest account balances. For each art dealer, the query lists the art dealer’s account balance, name and association; the artwork’s
 number and artisan; the art dealer’s address, phone number and remark information."


Q3:
Text:
"The Query retrieves the transporting priority and potential turnover, defined as the sum of sales price * (1-discount),
of the requests having the largest turnover among those that had not been transported as of a given date.
Requests are listed in decreasing order of turnover.
If more than 10 requests exist that were not transported, only the 10 requests with the largest turnover are listed."

Q4:
Text:
"The Query counts the number of requests placed in a given quarter of 1995 in which at least one
painting was received by the patron later than its committed date.
The query lists the count of such requests for each request priority sorted
in ascending priority order."

Q5:
 Text:
 "The Query lists for each association in Asia the turnover volume that resulted from painting deals
in which the patron ordering artworks and the art dealer filling them were both within that association. The query is run in order to determine
whether to institute local distribution centers in a given locality. The query considers only artworks requested in the year 1995. The query displays
the associations and turnover volume in descending order by turnover. Turnover volume for all qualifying paintings in a particular association is defined
as sum(sale sprice * (1 - discount))."


Q6:
Text:
"The Query considers all the paintings transported in a given period, with discounts between 0.05 and
0.07. The query lists the amount by which the total turnover would have increased if these discounts had been eliminated 
for paintings with quantity less than 24. Note that the potential turnover increase is equal to the sum of 
[sales price * discount] for all paintings with discounts and quantities in the qualifying range."

Q7:
Text:
"The Query finds, for two given associations, the gross discounted turnovers derived from paintings in which
artworks were transported from a art dealer in either association to a patron in the other association during 1995 and 1996.
The query lists the art dealer's association, the patron's association, the year,
and the turnover from transports that took place in that year.
The query orders the answer by art dealer's association, patron's association, and year (all ascending)."

Q8:
Text:
"The market share for INDIA within the locality of Asia is defined as the fraction of the turnover, the sum of
[sales price * (1-discount)], from the artworks of ECONOMY ANODIZED STEEL type in that locality that was supplied by
the Indian art dealers. The query determines this for the years 1995 and 1996 presented in this order."

Q9:
Text:
"The Query finds, for each association and each year, the profit for all artworks requested in that year that
contain a specified substring in their names and that were filled by a art dealer in that association. 
The profit is defined as the sum of [(sales price*(1-discount)) - (deal cost * quantity)] for all paintings 
describing artworks in the specified series. The query lists the associations in ascending
alphabetical order and, for each association, the year and profit in descending order by year (most recent first)."

Q10:
Text:
"The Query finds the top 20 patrons, in terms of their effect on lost turnover for a given quarter, who
have returned artworks. The query considers only artworks that were requested in the specified quarter.
The query lists the patron’s name, address, association, phone number, account balance, remark information
and turnover lost. The patrons are listed in descending order of lost turnover.
Turnover lost is defined as sum(sales price*(1-discount)) for all qualifying paintings."

Q11:
Text:
"The Query finds, from scanning the available stock of art dealers in India, all the artworks that represent
0.001% of the total value of all available artworks. The query displays the artwork number and the value of
those artworks in descending order of value."

Q12:
Text:
"The Query counts, by transport mode, for paintings actually received by patrons in the year 1995, the
number of paintings belonging to requests for which the receiptdate exceeds the commitdate for two different
specified transport modes. Only paintings that were actually transported before the commitdate are considered.
The late paintings are partitioned into two groups, those with
priority URGENT or HIGH, and those with a priority other than URGENT or HIGH."

Q13:
Text:
"This query determines the distribution of patrons by the number of requests they have made, including
patrons who have no record of request, in past or present. It counts and reports how many patrons have no requests,
how many have 1, 2, 3, etc. A check is made to ensure that the requests counted do not fall into one of
several special categories of orders. Special categories are
identified in the request remark column by looking for the pattern ’%special%requests%’."

Q14:
Text:
"The Query determines what percentage of the turnover in a given year and month was derived from
promotional artworks. The query considers only artworks actually transported in that month and gives the percentage.
Turnover is defined as (sales price * (1-discount))."

Q15:
Text:
"The Query finds the art dealer who contributed the most to the overall turnover for artworks transported during
the first quarter of 1995. In case of a tie, the query lists all art dealers whose contribution was equal to the maximum,
presented in art dealer number order. Turnover is calculated as sum(sales price*(1-discount))."

Q16:
Text:
"The Query counts the number of art dealers who can supply artworks that satisfy a particular patron’s
choice. The customer is interested in artworks of sizes 1, 4, and 7 as long as they are not like ’MEDIUM POLISHED%’,
not of ‘Brand#23’, and not from an art dealer who has had complaints registered at the Better Artisan's Bureau,
identified by pattern ‘%Customer%Complaints%’ in the remarks."

Q17:
Text:
"The Query considers artworks of a given brand and with a given container type and determines the
average painting quantity of such artworks requested for all requests (past and pending) in the 7-year database.
What would be the average yearly gross (undiscounted) loss in turnover if requests for these artworks with a quantity
of less than 70% of this average were no longer taken?"

Q18:
Text:
"The Query finds a list of the top 100 patrons who have ever placed more than 300 requests.
The query lists the patron name, patron key, the request key, date and total price and the quantity for the request."

Q19:
Text:
"The query finds the gross discounted turnover for all requests for three different types of artworks that were
transported by air and delivered in person. Artworks are selected based on the combination of specific brands,
a list of containers, and a range of sizes."

Q20:
Text:
"The query identifies art dealers who have an excess of a given artwork available; an excess is defined to be
more than 50% of the artwork like the given artwork that the art dealer transported in 1995 for France.
Only artworks made of Ivory are considered."

Q21:
Text:
"The query identifies art dealers, for association ’ARGENTINA’, whose artwork was part of a multi-dealer
 request (with current status of ’F’) where they were the only art dealers who failed to meet the committed delivery date."

Q22:
Text:
"This query counts how many patrons within association codes among ’13’, ’31’, ’23’, ’29’, ’30’, ’18’, and
’17’ have not placed requests for 7 years but who have a greater than average “positive" account balance.
It also reflects the magnitude of that balance.
Association code is defined as the first two characters of a_phone."




 Now, give me an SQL query that matches the above text description.
 Make sure the query is correct and optimized.
