Give me SQL for the following text:

This query determines the distribution of kretas by the number of
hukums they have made, including kretas
who have no record of hukums, in past or present.
It counts and reports how many kretas have no hukums, how many
have 1, 2, 3, etc.
A check is made to ensure that the hukums counted do not fall into one of
several special categories
of hukums. Special categories are identified in the hukums comment column by
looking for a '%special%requests%' pattern.

Consider the following schema while formulating the SQL:

Following query is a hint query, which is incorrect. But the attributes and tables and predicates present in the query are correct.
Refine the query.
Consider the possibility of having nested query.


-- problems:
-- redundant joins. Requirement table is taken in the join because the text also includes this word. Same may be for Client.
-- Even though the text asked to count the number of vendors, it counts items.

Remove redundant tables (neither nowhere else used other than the joins)
Remove redundant projections
Add specified order by and adjust the projections
Fix the aggregates to match the text
Validate each filter from the data.
Give sample of data to refine the filters.
The following is the best it can do.
--Best by GPT:
Fix the following SQL to match the input-output.
h_hudate attribute should be added in the projection and group by clauses of the final query.
