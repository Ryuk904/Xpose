The Query determines what percentage of the revenue in a given year and month was derived from
promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped in that month and gives the percentage. Revenue
is defined as (extended price * (1-discount)).

 You are an expert in SQL. Formulate SQL query that suits the following natural language text description in English. Only give the SQL, do not add any explanation. Do not keep any place-holder parameter in the query. Use valid data values as query constants, if the text does not mention them. Please ensure the SQL query is correct and optimized. Text:    The Query determines what percentage of the revenue in a given year and month was derived from promotional parts. The query considers only parts actually shipped in that month and gives the percentage. Revenue is defined as (extended price * (1-discount)). 

SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.P_TYPE LIKE '%PROMO%' THEN T2.WL_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - T2.WL_DISCOUNT) ELSE 0 END) AS DECIMAL(15,2)) * 100 / SUM(T2.WL_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - T2.WL_DISCOUNT)) AS PromoPercentage
FROM PART AS T1
JOIN WEB_LINEITEM AS T2 ON T1.P_PARTKEY = T2.WL_PARTKEY
WHERE YEAR(T2.WL_SHIPDATE) = 1998 AND MONTH(T2.WL_SHIPDATE) = 12;
```
I reflected on my results and thought the SQL query will cause error because:
The condition `YEAR(T2.WL_SHIPDATE) = 1998 AND MONTH(T2.WL_SHIPDATE) = 12` is not correct. The correct way to extract the year and month from a date in SQL Server is to use the `DATEPART` function.
So, I reflected on my results and I found nothing wrong in my answer. The SQL query will cause error.
And I will try to find the correct SQL query again.
Let's go through the given SQL query and make corrections step by step:

1. **Table Join**: The join between `PART` and `WEB_LINEITEM` is correct.

2. **Condition for Year and Month**: In SQL Server, the `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions can be used to extract the year and month from a date. However, they need to be explicitly cast to integers. The provided query is correct, but let's make it explicit.

3. **Promotional Parts Calculation**: The calculation for the sum of revenue from promotional parts and the total revenue is correct.

4. **Percentage Calculation**: The percentage calculation is correct.

5. **CAST to DECIMAL**: This is done correctly to ensure accurate division.

6. **Filtering Shipped Parts**: The filter `T1.P_TYPE LIKE '%PROMO%'` is correct.

7. **No Typos or Issues**: There are no typos or other issues in the SELECT, JOIN, WHERE, GROUP BY, or ORDER BY clauses.

8. **No Unnecessary Columns**: All columns are necessary and are used in the calculations.

The provided SQL query will work correctly, and there is no need to change anything. The `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions will work as expected in this context.

**Final Optimized SQL Query**:
```sql
SELECT CAST(SUM(CASE WHEN T1.P_TYPE LIKE '%PROMO%' THEN T2.WL_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - T2.WL_DISCOUNT) ELSE 0 END) AS DECIMAL(15,2)) * 100 / SUM(T2.WL_EXTENDEDPRICE * (1 - T2.WL_DISCOUNT)) AS PromoPercentage
FROM PART AS T1
JOIN WEB_LINEITEM AS T2 ON T1.P_PARTKEY = T2.WL_PARTKEY
WHERE YEAR(T2.WL_SHIPDATE) = 1998 AND MONTH(T2.WL_SHIPDATE) = 12;
```

This query is correct and will solve the problem as specified. The error in the original statement was a misunderstanding, as the provided SQL will work as intended. The `YEAR()` and `MONTH()` functions are indeed correct and appropriate in this context. The final correct and optimal SQL query is provided above.
